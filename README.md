## Overview

Getting a [serverless][] application all the way to production in AWS **correctly** and **securely** can be quite challenging. In particular, things like:

- Locking down IAM permissions to the minimum needed for different conceptual "roles" (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `ci`).
- Providing a scheme for different environments/stages (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).

... lack reasonable guidance to practically achieve in real world applications.

This [Terraform][] module provides a production-ready base of AWS permissions / resources to support a `serverless` framework application and help manage development / deployment workflows and maintenance. Specifically, it provides:

- **IAM Groups**: Role-specific groups to attach to AWS users to give humans and CI the minimum level of permissions locked to both a specific `serverless` service and stage/environment.

## Concepts

This module allows practical isolation / compartmentalization of privileges within a single AWS account along the following axes:

* **Stage/Environment**: An arbitrary environment to isolate -- this module doesn't restrict selection in any way other than there has to be at least one. In practice, a good set of choices may be something like `sandbox`, `development`, `staging`, `production`.
* **IAM Groups**: This module creates/enforces a scheme wherein:
    * **Admin**: AWS users assigned to the `admin` group can create/update/delete a `serverless` application and do pretty much anything that the `serverless` framework permits out of the box.
    * **Developer, CI**: AWS users assigned to the `developer|ci` groups can update a `serverless` application and do other things like view logs, perform rollbacks, etc.

In this manner, once an AWS superuser deploys a Terraform stack with this module and assigns IAM groups, the rest of the development / devops teams and CI can build and deploy Serverless applications to appropriate cloud targets with the minimum necessary privileges and isolation across services + environments + IAM roles.

## Modules

This project provides a core base module that is the minimum that must be used. Once the core is in place, then other optional submodules can be added.

- **Core (`/*`)**: Provides supporting IAM policies, roles, and groups so that an engineering team / CI can effectively create and maintain `serverless` Framework applications locked down to specific applications + environments with the minimum permissions needed.
- **X-Ray (`modules/xray`)**: Optional submodule to add needed IAM support to enable [AWS X-Ray][] performance tracing in a Serverless framework application. See the [submodule documentation](./modules/xray/README.md).
- **VPC (`modules/vpc`)**: Optional submodule to add needed IAM support to enable a Serverless framework application to deploy in [AWS VPC][]. See the [submodule documentation](./modules/vpc/README.md).

## IAM Notes

The IAM permissions are locked down to service + environment + role-specific ARNs as much as is possible within the AWS IAM and Serverless framework constraints. All of our modules/submodules use the same set of base ARNs declared, e.g., in [variables.tf](./variables.tf) and can be considered as follows:

**Fully locked down**: These ARNs are sufficiently locked to service + environment.

* `sls_cloudformation_arn`: Serverless-generated CloudFormation stack.
* `sls_deploy_bucket_arn`: Serverless deployment bucket that stores Lambda code. (Note that our ARN accounts for service name truncation).
* `sls_log_stream_arn`: Serverless target log stream.
* `sls_events_arn`: Serverless created CloudWatch events.
* `sls_lambda_arn`: Serverless lambda functions.
* `sls_lambda_role_arn`: Serverless lambda execution role.

**Not locked down**: These ARNs could be tighter, but presently are not.

* `sls_apigw_arn`: Serverless API Gateway. The issue is that the ID of the resource is dynamically created during Serverless initial provisioning, so this module can't know it ahead of time. We have [a filed issue](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/terraform-aws-serverless/issues/8) to track and research potential tightening solutions.
* `sls_apigw_tags_arn`: Tags for the Serverless API Gateway. Exact same issue as for `sls_apigw_arn`.

**IAM Wildcards**: Unfortunately, AWS IAM only allows wildcards (`"*"`) on certain resources, so we cannot actually lock down more. Accordingly, we limit the permissions to _only_ what is needed with a bias towards sticking such permissions in the `admin` IAM group. Here are our current wildcards:

_Core IAM module_

* `admin`
    - `cloudformation:ListStacks`
    - `cloudformation:PreviewStackUpdate`
    - `lambda:GetEventSourceMapping`
    - `lambda:ListEventSourceMappings`
    - `lambda:ListFunctions`
    - `lambda:ListTags`
    - `lambda:TagResource`
    - `lambda:UntagResource`
    - `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
* `developer|ci`:
    - `cloudformation:ValidateTemplate`
* One of the above (depending on `opt_many_lambdas`):
    - `logs:DescribeLogGroups`

_X-ray submodule_

* Lambda execution role:
    - `xray:PutTraceSegments`
    - `xray:PutTelemetryRecords`

_VPC submodule_

* `developer|ci`:
    - `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`
    - `ec2:DescribeVpcs`
    - `ec2:DescribeSubnets`
    - `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`
* Lambda execution role:
    - `ec2:CreateNetworkInterface`
    - `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`
    - `ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface` (It is disappointing that _deleting_ an ENI cannot be limited further...)

## Integration

### Reference project

Perhaps the easiest place to start is our [sample reference project][ref_project] that creates a Serverless framework service named `simple-reference` that integrates the core module and submodules of this project. The relevant files to review include:

- Terraform infrastructure
    - [aws/bootstrap.yml](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/blob/master/aws/bootstrap.yml): Terraform remote state storage / bootstrap.
    - [terraform/variables.tf](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/blob/master/terraform/variables.tf): Terraform variables.
    - [terraform/main.tf](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/blob/master/terraform/main.tf): Terraform resources / integration.
- Serverless framework
    - [serverless.yml](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/blob/master/serverless.yml): Serverless framework configuration.
- Example Node.js handlers/servers
    - [src/server/base.js](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/blob/master/src/server/base.js): Example "hello world" server using only the core `serverless` module.

### Module integration

Here's a basic integration of the core `serverless` module:

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "stage" {
  description = "The stage/environment to deploy to. Suggest: `sandbox`, `development`, `staging`, `production`."
  default     = "development"
}

# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

# Core `serverless` IAM support.
module "serverless" {
  source = "FormidableLabs/serverless/aws"

  region       = "us-east-1"
  service_name = "sparklepants"
  stage        = "${var.stage}"

  # (Default values)
  # iam_region          = `*`
  # iam_partition       = `*`
  # iam_account_id      = `AWS_CALLER account`
  # iam_stage           = `STAGE`
  # tf_service_name     = `tf-SERVICE_NAME`
  # sls_service_name    = `sls-SERVICE_NAME`
  # lambda_role_name    = ""
  # role_admin_name     = `admin`
  # role_developer_name = `developer`
  # role_ci_name        = `ci`
  # opt_many_lambdas    = false
  # opt_disable_groups  = false
  # tags = {}
}
```

That pairs with a `serverless.yml` configuration:

```yml
# This value needs to either be `sls-` + `service_name` module input *or*
# be specified directly as the module input `sls_service_name`, e.g.:
# - `sls-{service_name}`
# - `{sls_service_name}`
service: sls-${self:custom.service}

custom:
  service: "sparklepants"
  stage: ${opt:stage, "development"}

provider:
  name: aws
  # Use the role provided by `terraform-aws-serverless.`
  #
  # **NOTE**: terraform-aws-serverless uses its own Lambda execution role
  # in favor of the Serverless default. It has the same permissions, but
  # allows you to attach IAM policies to it before running `sls deploy`.
  # This prevents failures when trying to run Terraform before deploying
  # your Serverless app.
  role:
    Fn::ImportValue: tf-${self:custom.service}-${self:custom.stage}-LambdaExecutionRoleArn
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  region: "us-east-1"
  stage: ${self:custom.stage}

functions:
  server:
    # ...

layers:
  # Layers defined within a serverless project need be named with a prefix
  # matching the service name in one of the following formats:
  # - `sls-{service_name}-{stage}-{ANYTHING}`
  # - `{sls_service_name}-{stage}-{ANYTHING}`
  vendor:
    path: layers/vendor
    name: sls-${self:custom.service}-${self:custom.stage}-vendor
```

Let's unpack the parameters a bit more (located in [variables.tf](variables.tf)):

- `service_name`: A service name is something that defines the unique application that will match up with the serverless application. E.g., something boring like `simple-reference` or `graphql-server` or exciting like `unicorn` or `sparklepants`.
- `stage`: The current stage that will match up with the `serverless` framework deployment. These are arbitrary, but can be something like `development`/`staging`/`production`.
- `region`: The deployed region of the service. Defaults to the current caller's AWS region. E.g., `us-east-1`.
- `lambda_role_name`: A custom Lambda execution role to use instead of the module default. If using the `xray` or `vpc` modules, make sure to pass this same option and role to them.
- `iam_region`: The [AWS region][] to limit IAM privileges to. Defaults to `*`. The difference with `region` is that `region` has to be one specific region like `us-east-1` to match up with Serverless framework resources, whereas `iam_region` can be a single region or `*` wildcard as it's just an IAM restriction.
- `iam_partition`: The [AWS partition][] to limit IAM privileges to. Defaults to `*`.
- `iam_account_id`: The [AWS account ID][] to limit IAM privileges to. Defaults to the current caller's account ID.
- `iam_stage`: The stage to limit IAM privileges to. Defaults to the `stage` variable. Wildcarding stage (e.g. `nonprod-*`) is a strategy for isolating dynamic environments (e.g. pull request environments) from production ones.
- `tf_service_name`: The service name for Terraform-created resources. It is very useful to distinguish between those created by Terraform / this module and those created by the Serverless framework. By default, `tf-${service_name}` for "Terraform". E.g., `tf-simple-reference` or `tf-sparklepants`.
- `sls_service_name`: The service name for Serverless as defined in `serverless.yml` in the `service` field. Highly recommended to match our default of `sls-${service_name}` for "Serverless".
- `role_admin_name`: The name for the IAM group, policy, etc. for administrators. (Default: `admin`).
- `role_developer_name`: The name for the IAM group, policy, etc. for developers. (Default: `developer`).
- `role_ci_name`: The name for the IAM group, policy, etc. for Continuous Integration (CI) / automation. (Default: `ci`).
- `opt_many_lambdas`: By default, only the `admin` group can create and delete Lambda functions which gives extra security for a "mono-Lambda" application approach. However, many Lambda applications utilize multiple different functions which need to be created and deleted by the `developer` and `ci` group. Setting this option to `true` enables Lambda function create/delete privileges for all groups. (Default: `false`)
- `opt_disable_groups`: Disables group and group attachment creation while still creating matching IAM policies. Useful in federated accounts or in environments where access is restricted to assumed roles.


Most likely, an AWS superuser will be needed to run the Terraform application for these IAM / other resources.

### AWS IAM group integration

Once the core module is applied, three IAM groups will be created in the form of `${tf_service_name}-${stage}-(admin|developer|ci)`. This typically looks something like:

- `tf-${service_name}-${stage}-admin`: Can create/delete/update the Severless app and global resources like tags.
- `tf-${service_name}-${stage}-developer`: Can deploy the Severless app.
- `tf-${service_name}-${stage}-ci`: Can deploy the Severless app.

Once these groups exist, an AWS superuser can then attach these groups to AWS individual users as appropriate for the combination of service + stage + role (admin, developer, CI). Or, the IAM group attachments could be controlled via Terraform as well!

The main upshot of this is after attachment, a given AWS user has the minimum necessary privileges for exactly the level of Serverless framework commands they need. Our example Serverless application [reference project][ref_project] documentation has many examples of various `serverless` commands and which IAM group can properly run them.

## Maintenance Status

**Stable:** Formidable is not planning to develop any new features for this project. We are still responding to bug reports and security concerns. We are still welcoming PRs for this project, but PRs that include new features should be small and easy to integrate and should not include breaking changes.
